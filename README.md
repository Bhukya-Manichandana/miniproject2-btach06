•	A file manager (destiny) is a computer program that provides a user interface to manage files and folders of different formats (E.g.: - pdfs, doc’s, jpg files etc..). The most common operations performed on files or groups of files includes opening (E.g., viewing, playing, editing or printing), renaming, moving or copying, deleting and searching for files.
•	Given a folder with multiple files in different formats (text, image, video, etc.), create a system that allows users to easily sort, merge, improving their productivity. The system should have a graphical user interface (GUI) that makes it easy for users to perform these tasks, reducing the need for technical expertise. Additionally, the system should be customizable, allowing users to add extra features and functionalities as need.
